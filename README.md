![fundit-home-735x470](https://premium.wpmudev.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fundit-home-735x470-583x372.jpg) Create, host and manage your fundraisers and keep all the proceeds.

### More Money for Your Project

Services like Kickstarter and Indiegogo take as much as 11% for admin and processing fees. Lose the outrageous fees and put the funds directly into your nonprofit, indie record release, or crazy invention instead.


### Power Features & Simple Setup

If you're looking for a heavy duty fundraising system with thousands of settings – this isn't it. Other plugins can do that. Fundraising adds just the power-features for simple crowdfunding and quick setup.

### Integrate With Your Theme

The easy ‘getting started’ guide will have you creating fundraisers immediately. Five included style templates, the in-post shortcode generator and built-in widgets make integration with your existing theme simple.

### Easy Payment Processing

Fundraising includes Paypal integration for convenience or lets you keep 100% of the donation with a manual processing option. Watch your progress bar climb. Process gifts in real-time at your next event. Input cash gifts, credit cards and pledges.

### Rewards & Milestones

Set a start and end date with a specific goal and wait to take payment until the project is funded, or take donations as they come in. Create reward packages and limit availability to motivate potential supporters. Fundraising makes it easy!
