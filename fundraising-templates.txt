You can create new files inside your active theme's root folder to be used when displaying a fundraiser.

There are 3 types of templates you can create.

== Custom Template Functions ==
You can change the location of the template-functions that are loaded in fundraising to an external location.
This will insure that any custom changes you make to your template functions are not broken when updating the plugin in the future.

Add a new define statement in your wp-config.php file containing a string pointing to the location.
define('WDF_CUSTOM_TEMPLATE_FUNCTIONS','/full-server-path/and/filename.php');
